### Looping over Arrays Homework - due Wed, Feb 14 @ 11pm
#### (please don't stay up all night and make sure to get plenty of sleep!)

## Before getting started, here's how to submit the homework
1. Fork this repo to your own account
2. Clone it to your local machine from your account
3. Do the homework in the `practice.js` file
4. Push your work up to github with the following steps:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "commit message goes here"`
  - `git push origin master`
  - On github, open up a pull request
  - Add your name to the title section and create the pull request

To test your code, run `node practice.js` in the terminal (make sure you're in the same directory as the file)

## Ok here's the actual homework assignment
Given an array...

1. Return an `array` of only even numbers.
`[234, 11, 21, 88, 1212, 6632, 00, 1]`

2. Return an `array` of all words that have vowels.
    *Hint: the [indexOf() method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp) is useful to check if a specific letter is in a string*
`['ryan', 'ada', 'ppzpp', 'brgggg', 'eric']`

3. Return an `array` of all of the "truthy" values.
`[true, 1, 0, 'elephant', undefined, NaN]`

**Bonus**

4. Return the `number` that is the average of all the numbers in the array.

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7]`
